# Document Object Model (DOM)

The DOM structure represents the hierarchical nature of an HTML or XML document as a tree of objects, where each object corresponds to an element or part of the document. 


- Document Node
    - Top level node in the DOM hierarchy
    - Represents the entire html document
    - Contains all the other nodes and html elements
- Element Nodes
    - Represents HTML elements in the document, such as `<div>` `<p>` `<a>`
    - Element nodes can have attributes, child nodes, and contents
- Attribute Nodes
    - Represent attributes of HTML elements
    - Attribute nodes are typically attached to their respective element nodes
    - `src` is an attribute of an `<img>` element
